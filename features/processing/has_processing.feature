Feature: Has processing
  In order to be retrieve processing results
  As a developer
  I want to be able to check if a repository has processings

    Given I have a project with name "Kalibro"
    And I have a configuration with name "Java"
    And I have a reading group with name "Group"
    And I have a loc configuration within the given configuration
    And the given project has the following Repositories:
      |   name    | scm_type |                  address                    |
