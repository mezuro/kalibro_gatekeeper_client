  In order to be able to retrieve processing results
  As a developer
  I want to be able to check the last ready processing

  @kalibro_restart @kalibro_processor_restart
  Scenario: With one repository just after with ready processing
    Given I have a project with name "Kalibro"
    And I have a configuration with name "Java"
    And I have a reading group with name "Group"
    And I have a loc configuration within the given configuration
    And the given project has the following Repositories:
      |   name    | scm_type |                  address                    |
      | "Kalibro" |    GIT   | https://git.gitorious.org/sbking/sbking.git |
    And I call the process method for the given repository
    And I wait up for a ready processing
    When I call the last_ready_processing_of method for the given repository
    Then I should get a Processing
    And this processing should have process times
